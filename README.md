Code Quiz 

## Description
The motivation behind the project was to create a code quiz for people to test their knowledge of different topics in Javascript. We built this project to be able to test for the correct answers of the questions to ultimately generate a score for the person taking the quiz and see how they do in a specified time frame and incorrect answers will deduct time from the quiz. The questions must be answered within that timeframe. It solves the problem of being able to utilize the quiz so they can input what they think the correct answer is and seeing if it matches the actual answer. I learned a lot about creating time intervals in javascript, as well as how to manipulate css, html and javascript together so that each part can work hand in hand to create a working code. I also learned a lot about appending elements, storing data into a local storage, and using JSON parse. 


## Usage

This website can be used by first clicking the Start Button on the quiz to be showcased a series of questions that must be answered on javascript. You answer each question by clicking on the answer that you believe is correct which will prompt you to the next question until all questions are answered. If the answer is inccorect, time will be deducted. Your answers will be stored at the end which will generate a score for you quiz as well as an option to input your initials which will be recorded in a highscores list.
